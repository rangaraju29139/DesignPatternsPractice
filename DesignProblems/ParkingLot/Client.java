/* Requirements:
1. Generate the Ticket workflow

// way to think
1. which model is it about? Ticket
2. TicketController, TicketService,TicketRepository.

//should ticket controller methods take models as parameters or should there be any problem?
1. Db model should not be exposed.
2. try to take a single parameter in controller , so that for the new parameters the code doesnot break in future.
